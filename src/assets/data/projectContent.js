The linking file references the location of project core image files and numerical datafiles but does not include them in the file. Therefore, file locations must be updated in the linking file using a text editor or through the software for use on a new user's computer. Data files (.xml format) typically include Geotek MSCL-S and Geotek MSCL-XYZ data. Additional data such as XRF, loss-on ignition or other data sets may be included."

The parameters measured include P-wave velocity, gamma density, magnetic susceptibility, electrical resitivity, natural gamma. The core sections are pushed through the sensors at a specified interval (typically 0.5 cm) and the core is scanned as it passes. The instrument can be configured to log whole or split cores. Core diameter can range from 5 to 15 cm with lengths up to 155 cm."

The XYZ measures high resolution magnetic susceptibility using a Bartington MS2E point sensor. Color reflectance data are collected using a Minolta CM-2600d color spectrophotometer. These measurements are collected at a specified interval (typically 0.5 cm). Up to 9 cores can be loaded at once, allowing for cores to be run unattended sequentially."
