export const aboutContent = "<p> Open Core Data is a next-generation approach to data management opening vast stores of continental coring and drilling data to new and innovative scientific use. </p><p> Open Core Data is radically improving discoverability, accessibility, citability, preservation, and integration of data from past, current, and future drilling and coring projects. The Open Core Data website allows flexible data access for site visitors, with even more powerful capabilities for programmatic data access through semantic data enhancement and machine readable formats. Open Core Data is the long-term data discovery and distribution system for all continental drilling and coring data, for optimal access by individual investigators and students, discipline-specific data systems, and data archives. Open Core Data allows data generated at facilities (e.g. core scanning and logging data) and investigator home institutions (e.g. isotopic data) to be linked and accessible for integrated data assessments, with provenance concepts embedded in the architecture.</p><p> Open Core Data is a collaboration between the Consortium for Ocean Leadership, Continental Scientific Drilling (CSD) Facility, and the EarthChem Library.</p>"
